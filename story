StoryTelling of ESTATE DATASET
I analyzed a dataset of house prices including features like area, bedrooms, and proximity to roads
. The average house price was around ₹4,500,000 with values ranging widely up to ₹13,000,000
. Price and area both showed high standard deviations, indicating a lot of variety in house types and locations
. The data is right-skewed, meaning some very expensive houses are pulling the average up. Most houses had 2 to 4 bedrooms,
  and interestingly, some large houses were not the most expensive, suggesting other factors like location and furnishing mattered
. Boxplots showed outliers in both price and area, hinting at luxury properties or possibly incorrect entries
. Overall, the market seems diverse, with area being a factor but not the sole indicator of price
. This suggests buyers should consider multiple variables, not just size.
